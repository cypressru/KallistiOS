    \brief   Xbox-specific kos-load addresses.
    \ingroup vfs_kosload

    Defines the syscall vector address and magic address for kos-load (kos-tool's
    xbox-load-ip) on the original Xbox. Included automatically by
    kernel/fs/fs_kosload.c via the arch-specific include path; do not include
    directly.

    The Xbox loader publishes a small guest-facing header at a fixed low-memory
    address: the magic value at +0 and the syscall function pointer at +4. This
    matches the PlayStation 2 layout (adjacent magic/pointer words) rather than
    the Dreamcast's separate BIOS-RAM addresses; VEC_KOSLOAD is the address of
    the pointer word, which the shared code dereferences once to get the
    callable.
